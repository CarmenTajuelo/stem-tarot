# 🔮 Tarot STEM

A simple **React application** to display and explore tarot cards using a public API created by [@MAlexGG](https://github.com/MAlexGG).  
Each card combines a **tarot arcane** with the story of a **woman in STEM**, turning them into contemporary goddesses 👩‍🔬.  

This project is developed under the **Factoria F5** framework, a bootcamp that empowers women and promotes inclusion in tech.

## ✨ Features

- Display all tarot cards (face down by default).  
- Click on a card to see its **arcane meaning** and the **STEM goddess** associated with it.  
- Make a **three-card reading** (Past, Present, Future).  
- Restart the reading at any time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
